## Developing

### Set up

Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), then from the repository root:

```bash
mise install                # installs Python 3.14 and uv
uv sync                     # creates .venv and installs all dependencies
uv run pre-commit install   # installs the git hooks
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```
